# GScience Virtual Machine (GVM)
## 1. What is GVM
An virtual machine like JVM, dot Net CRL but simpler. The project is created just for fun, and maybe with a lot of bugs. Please just turn around and leave if you think the whole project is useless.

I decided to add multiplatform supportion, which means that with one compilation the program can run in different platforms.
### Supported platform
- Windows
More platform supportion will be added.
